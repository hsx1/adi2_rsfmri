abstract = "Global signal regression (GSR) is one of the most debated preprocessing strategies for resting-state functional MRI. GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures. Code for the variance component model and ridge regression can be found here: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/preprocessing/Li2019_GSR."

abstract = "Recent studies have illustrated that motion-related artifacts remain in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data even after common corrective processing procedures have been applied, but the extent to which head motion distorts the data may be modulated by the corrective approach taken. We compare two different methods for estimating nuisance signals from tissues not expected to exhibit BOLD fMRI signals of neuronal origin: 1) the more commonly used mean signal method and 2) the principal components analysis approach (aCompCor: Behzadi et al., 2007). Further, we investigate the added benefit of “scrubbing” (Power et al., 2012) following both methods. We demonstrate that the use of aCompCor removes motion artifacts more effectively than tissue-mean signal regression. In addition, inclusion of more components from anatomically defined regions of no interest better mitigates motion-related artifacts and improves the specificity of functional connectivity estimates. While scrubbing further attenuates motion-related artifacts when mean signals are used, scrubbing provides no additional benefit in terms of motion artifact reduction or connectivity specificity when using aCompCor."

No effect of the feeding condition was found.

**Within-patients: presurgery vs one month vs one year follow-up.** A main effect of time on connectivity was found in the PCC (p < 0.002), in the precuneus (p < 0.003), in the left supplementary motor area (SMA) (p < 0.004) and in the right posterior middle temporal gyrus (p < 0.005), the right amygdala (p < 0.006) and the vermis (p < 0.01) (Table 2). A main effect of the feeding condition was found in the left occipital fusiform gyrus (p < 0.000) and in the left posterior temporal fusiform gyrus (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

**Across groups** Some seed-to-ROI connections, which were stronger in patients presurgery when compared with controls, appeared to have weakened after surgery (Table 3). 
* Specifically, connectivity between the precuneus and the left anterior STG was stronger in presurgery patients compared with controls, but was weaker in patients after one month and one year follow-up, compared with presurgery (Fig. 1). 
* Moreover, no differences were found in the connectivity between these regions when comparing controls and patients after one year follow-up. The same pattern was seen for connectivity from the PCC to the left aSTG and the right anterior temporal fusiform gyrus (Fig. 1), suggesting that these connections are the most prominently involved in determining obesity in these patients and the most affected by the surgery.},

- Generally more active in obese, no increase in posterior cingulate activation after overfeeding that is seen in normal-weigh individuals.

- As such, greater activation of the default network by reduced-obese individuals may reflect increased attention to their internal states such appetite or  other processing of gut signals or food‐related cognitive factors. The  observed positive correlation between parietal default network activity  and measured appetite across both lean and RO individuals supports this  hypothesized relationship. These effects may have been especially  pronounced in the present study because all subjects were scanned in the fasted state.},

Nonrandomized comparator groups, imperfect but still useful, can be identified through alternative designs, such as **use of a contemporaneously measured unexposed cohort with similar characteristics.  Finally, quasi‐experimental designs provide stronger evidence** than do uncontrolled interventions in which investigators simply look at change from baseline and a group of treated cases. Ignoring the potential effects of RTM can lead to unsubstantiated inferences about the effects of treatments that can lead to wasted time, money, and other societal resources and distract from alternative interventions that may be more valuable.},
